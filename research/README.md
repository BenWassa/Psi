# Research Folder README
This folder contains the **historical sources, reference material, and AI-generated outputs** that support the core content of the project. Each research run explores a targeted topic or prompt using multiple AI models, followed by critique and consolidation into usable material for scripts, visuals, and narrative development.

## ðŸ”„ Research Workflow

Each deep research run follows a streamlined 4-step process:

### **Step 1: Run Prompt Across AI Models**

* Use **2â€“3 different AI tools** (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude) for a single prompt.
* Save each modelâ€™s response as a separate markdown file (e.g., `P1_ChatGPT.md`, `P1_Gemini.md`, etc.).

### **Step 2: Choose a Synthesizing Model**

* Pick **ChatGPT or Gemini** to perform the consolidation work.
* These models are best suited for distilling large bodies of research into coherent outputs.

### **Step 3: Run the Critique Prompt**

Use the **Critique Prompt** below in ChatGPT to evaluate all raw outputs.

> **Prompt:**
> You are an expert research auditor. Review the following AI-generated research outputs for a deep-dive prompt. For each output:
>
> * Summarize its **unique contributions** (examples, insights, angles)
> * Note any **overlaps or redundancies**
> * Identify **missing or underdeveloped areas**
> * Evaluate **factual accuracy and interpretive depth**
> * Flag **best quotes, vivid details, or structure**
> * Finally, recommend which outputs to prioritize and how to structure the synthesis
>
> **Output format**: Clear bullet points under each section + a final consolidation strategy

### **Step 4: Generate the Final Summary**

Once critique is complete, run the **Consolidated Summary Prompt** to synthesize a final version:

> **Prompt:**
You are synthesizing multiple high-quality research outputs into a single, coherent, symbolically resonant summary. This synthesis is intended to support a narrative-psychological project (e.g. podcast, essay, script, or educational artifact) focused on how cultures imagine the soul, self, or inner life across time.

Objectives:
Retain the strongest symbolic examples, metaphors, quotes, and psychological insights

Eliminate redundancy while honoring culturally distinct contributions and motifs

Clarify how each worldview reflects a theory of the inner life, even if implicit

Allow for complexity and ambiguity without over-explaining or collapsing models into each other

Structure:
1. Narrative Glimpses

Short, vivid summaries or symbols from each tradition that illustrate key ideas (e.g., descent myths, soul-judgments, initiatory visions)

2. Cultural-Psychological Models

Key beliefs about the self/soul: structure (if any), conflict, origin, transformation

Associated rituals, ethics, or metaphysical assumptions

3. Psychological Reflections

What inner conflicts, existential questions, or ethical dilemmas these models sought to address

How they model internal order, fragmentation, desire, memory, or purification

Style & Formatting:
Markdown output

Bold section headers

Short, well-structured paragraphs or bullet points

In-text numbered citations for classical sources and primary texts (e.g., [1], [2])

Endnotes section with numbered full references to primary sources only (not research summaries)

Maintain a balance of intellectual rigor, narrative flow, and symbolic depth. When in doubt, favor conceptual clarity and cross-cultural resonance.

## ðŸ“¦ Output Formats

You may export the final product in one or more of the following forms:

* **Structured Notes** â€“ for internal archival or future retrieval
* **Narrative Summary** â€“ for direct use in scripts or essays
* **Visual Planning** â€“ for infographics or educational content
