# Research Folder README
This folder contains the **historical sources, reference material, and AI-generated outputs** that support the core content of the project. Each research run explores a targeted topic or prompt using multiple AI models, followed by critique and consolidation into usable material for scripts, visuals, and narrative development.

## ðŸ”„ Research Workflow

Each deep research run follows a streamlined 4-step process:

### **Step 1: Run Prompt Across AI Models**

* Use **2â€“3 different AI tools** (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude) for a single prompt.
* Save each modelâ€™s response as a separate markdown file (e.g., `P1_ChatGPT.md`, `P1_Gemini.md`, etc.).

### **Step 2: Choose a Synthesizing Model**

* Pick **ChatGPT or Gemini** to perform the consolidation work.
* These models are best suited for distilling large bodies of research into coherent outputs.

### **Step 3: Run the Critique Prompt**

Use the **Critique Prompt** below in ChatGPT to evaluate all raw outputs.

> **Prompt:**
> You are an expert research auditor. Review the following AI-generated research outputs for a deep-dive prompt. For each output:
>
> * Summarize its **unique contributions** (examples, insights, angles)
> * Note any **overlaps or redundancies**
> * Identify **missing or underdeveloped areas**
> * Evaluate **factual accuracy and interpretive depth**
> * Flag **best quotes, vivid details, or structure**
> * Finally, recommend which outputs to prioritize and how to structure the synthesis
>
> **Output format**: Clear bullet points under each section + a final consolidation strategy

### **Step 4: Generate the Final Summary**

Once critique is complete, run the **Consolidated Summary Prompt** to synthesize a final version:

> **Prompt:**
> You are synthesizing multiple high-quality research outputs into a single, coherent summary. Your goals are:
>
> * Retain the **strongest examples, quotes, and psychological insights**
> * Avoid redundancy while **honoring unique contributions** (e.g., Dumuzi, Sargon, omen tablets)
> * Use structured formatting with clear sections:
>
>   * Narrative Examples
>   * Cultural Interpretation
>   * Psychological Reflections
> * Balance **scholarly richness** with **clarity and narrative flow** for future use (script, essay, infographic)
> * Where appropriate, **attribute ideas to specific models or sources**
>
> **Output format**: Markdown, with bold section headers, bullet points or short paragraphs, and clear logic flow

## ðŸ“¦ Output Formats

You may export the final product in one or more of the following forms:

* **Structured Notes** â€“ for internal archival or future retrieval
* **Narrative Summary** â€“ for direct use in scripts or essays
* **Visual Planning** â€“ for infographics or educational content

## ðŸ§ª Status

**Phase 1**: Research for the pilot episode is currently underway.
All outputs from Prompt 1 (Mesopotamian Dream Stories & Psychological Function) have been collected and reviewed.
