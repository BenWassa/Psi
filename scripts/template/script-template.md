**Project Psi – Dual-Narrator Script Template**

### 🎙️ Script Formatting Guidelines

* Use `[Narrator A]:` for the **analytical** voice (expository, factual, structured).
* Use `[Narrator B]:` for the **reflective** voice (emotional, metaphorical, human).
* Alternate naturally between narrators. A/B pacing can be flexible (e.g., AAB, ABAB, BAA).
* Use markdown for structure: `# Title`, `## Section`, `---` for breaks.
* Italics for internal thoughts or emphasis. No sound cues in this version.

### 🧪 Example Format

```
# Episode 001 – The Origins of the Psyche
## Ancient Foundations

[Narrator A]:
In the ruins of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, we find the earliest traces of psychological thought—not as science, but as soulwork embedded in ritual, dreams, and the divine order.

[Narrator B]:
They didn’t ask, "What is the mind?" They asked, "Where does the soul travel when we sleep?" Their answers weren’t framed in data, but in myth and movement—in sand, smoke, and stars.

---

## The Birth of Questions

[Narrator A]:
In Greece, we begin to see a shift. Plato’s tripartite soul—reason, spirit, appetite—wasn’t just philosophy. It was an early map of internal conflict. A proto-psychology.

[Narrator B]:
You can almost feel the inner pull—the war inside a person between what they know, what they feel, and what they want. Some things don’t change, even over millennia.

## Reflection Prompt (Optional)
- What do you believe about the self that isn't scientific, but still feels deeply true?
```

### 🔧 Technical Notes

* Ideal length: 1,000–1,500 words
* Use `---` between thematic sections (≈3–5 per episode)
* Optional: Append `[Polaris Prompts]` or `[Athena Notes]` at end for scaffolding
