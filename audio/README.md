PODCAST 1 APPROACH
# 🎙️ Project Psi – Episode 1 Scaffold: “Before the Mind Was Measured”

## 1. OVERVIEW & INTENT

This episode begins Project Psi’s exploration into how the soul was imagined before psychology existed. Through five symbolic dreamworlds, we trace humanity’s early mythic and ritual understandings of consciousness, identity, and transformation.

This is not a historical lecture — it’s a dream ritual in audio form. Listeners enter a liminal space where myths whisper their truths. The goal is to **evoke**, not just explain.

## 2. NARRATIVE SHAPE

Episode structure mimics an ancient **dream incubation ritual**:

1. **Light the Candles** – Symbolic introductions to five dreamworlds
2. **Let the Vision Unfold** – Immersive, emotionally resonant segments
3. **Close the Circle** – Final reflection tying myth to modern psyche

Each segment is a **mirror** — not a history lesson — echoing something we still carry in the unconscious.

- Disoriented, in a good way — like waking from a meaningful dream  
- Emotionally charged with ancient symbols  
- Awakened to the fact that modern psychology was once *mythic dreaming*  
- Ready to ask: *What survives from these stories in me now?*
