# Project Psi Ψ

*A living chronicle of psychological thought — unfolding through voices, stories, and shifting paradigms. Starts as a lean podcast, expands into a symbolic learning environment bridging past and present.*

---

## 🎧 Overview

**Project Psi** is a narrative-driven, audio-first exploration of psychology's evolution. Told through human stories and dual-perspective narration, it presents the history of thought not as static knowledge, but as a dynamic journey of minds, movements, and meaning-making.

We begin lean — with an intimate, episodic podcast — and grow into a modular, symbolic learning platform. This repo houses the core scripts, research layers, and visual planning for that journey.

## 🌱 Long-Term Vision

Project Psi is a ritual of remembrance, a reclaiming of psychological lineage for modern minds. It grows into a symbolic, immersive space — bridging past and present through stories, structure, and self-inquiry.
