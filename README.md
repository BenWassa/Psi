# Project Psi Ψ

*A ritual of remembrance, tracing the dream of psychology before it had a name.*

---

## 🎧 Project Overview

**Project Psi** is a narrative podcast and symbolic research project exploring the **origins and evolution of psychological thought** — not through textbooks or timelines, but through immersive storytelling, mythic structure, and emotionally intelligent design.

It begins as a ***lean audio series***: each episode a *ritualized journey* through a different era’s idea of the soul, psyche, and self.

From there, Psi will grow into a **modular symbolic platform** — part archive, part dream-machine, part guided mythological education.

Think:

- Carl Jung meets Joseph Campbell meets immersive audio design  
- A mythic museum of the mind, built for the 21st century

## ✨ New Narrative Shape (Post-Scope-Creep Recovery)

**Old Scope**: Five discrete research-heavy segments  
**New Shape**: One emotionally anchored arc → Five mythic mirrors

> 🎙️ *Episode 1: "Before the Mind Was Measured"*  
> A journey through five ancient dreamworlds — from Mesopotamia to Plato — tracing how cultures imagined the soul before psychology emerged as a science.

Each cultural lens (Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Greek, Orphic, Platonic) is now a **symbolic reflection**, not a standalone module.

The episode structure follows the rhythm of a **dream ritual**:

1. Light the candles — one mythic glimpse at a time
2. Let the vision unfold — connected by tone, not taxonomy
3. Close the circle — ask: What survives from these stories in us now?

## 🎙️ Production Loop (Lean & Constrained)

> *No source enters the workflow unless it earns a place in the final 15-min arc.*

### 🛠️ 1. Dual AI Research

* Prompt each source (Gemini + GPT/Claude)
* Cull and critique to top **3 insights per prompt**

### 🧠 2. Beat Extraction

* Identify:

  * Story beats
  * Emotional tones
  * Symbols/metaphors
  * Psychological function

### 🎧 3. Scratch Narration

* Record or synthesize each beat (voice notes or ElevenLabs)
* Evaluate narrative clarity + emotional rhythm

### 🧩 4. Audio Board Assembly

* Tag each beat with timestamp, tone, and theme in NotebookLM
* Align structure like a guided dream or ritual

### 🔁 5. Iterate the Arc

* Revise story flow until it feels like a **cohesive inner journey**

### ⏱️ 6. Track the Burn Rate™

* Log hours per step (research → beat → audio)
* Use this to scope future episodes and team bandwidth

## 🔭 Vision Statement
> **Project Psi is not just a podcast — it’s an excavation.** A ritual of remembrance, tracing how ancient cultures dreamed, dissected, and dramatized the inner world before psychology had a name.
>
> Psi is a guided descent through the symbolic ruins of mind — before diagnostics, before data, before Freud ever dreamed of dreams.
>
> It is built as a modular, symbolic learning platform — blending myth, narrative, and research into something between a lecture, a guided meditation, and a museum.

As it grows, Psi becomes:

* A **mythic map of psychological evolution** across eras and cultures
* A **toolkit for modern seekers**, using ancient insight to navigate identity, struggle, and self-understanding
* A **curated archive of symbolic frameworks** for building inner meaning in a disenchanted age

> The soul survives. We just need to learn to speak its tongue again.
