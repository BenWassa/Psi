**Project Psi – Vision Stack Summary**

---

### 1. Core Purpose

To retell the history of psychology as a human journey — not as a cold progression of theories, but as a living story of minds, struggles, and shifting paradigms. *Project Psi* exists to make psychological thought emotionally resonant, intellectually grounded, and personally meaningful.

---

### 2. Primary Format

*Project Psi* begins as a **chronological, narrative-driven podcast**. The audio-first format offers accessibility, intimacy, and flexibility. It supports a lean launch while enabling emotional storytelling and modular growth.

---

### 3. Narrative Style

Scripts will use a **dual narrator model**:

* *Analytical Voice*: explains, critiques, connects ideas
* *Reflective Voice*: wonders, emotes, humanizes

This may be partially implemented in audio depending on tooling limitations. However, all written content (scripts, transcripts) will reflect this dual voice structure.

### 4. Modular Growth Path

**Four-phase expansion roadmap:**

1. **Lean Core:** Audio episodes (10–15 mins), chronological spine
2. **Tier 1:** Companion docs, glossaries, transcripts, prompts
3. **Tier 2:** Interactive concept maps, timelines, thematic deep dives
4. **Tier 3:** Immersive website, community features, scholarly partnerships

---

### 5. Audience Design

The core audience is the **thoughtful, self-driven learner** — past the intro level, but not seeking PhD-level abstraction. The project balances clarity and rigor, appealing to integrative thinkers who want historical depth, narrative flow, and reflective insight.

Future expansions may include labeled pathways for general learners or specialists.

### 6. Key Differentiators

*Project Psi* stands out by:

* **Centering narrative:** Emotions and meaning precede facts and citations
* **Dual voice storytelling:** Two narrators model thought and feeling
* **Modular design:** Lean core built for expandable formats
* **Cross-cultural and critical framing:** Challenges dominant narratives, highlights overlooked thinkers
* **Symbolic coherence:** History is treated as an evolving quest for meaning

### 7. Symbolic / Long-Term Vision

Beyond episodes and documents, *Project Psi* is a symbolic act of remembrance and re-integration. It seeks to reconnect modern minds with the long lineage of psychological thought — not to glorify the past, but to reclaim its insights, caution against its errors, and shape wiser futures.

This is a ritual of clarity, memory, and transformation.
