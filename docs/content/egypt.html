<h2>Egyptian Soul Architecture</h2>
<p>Ancient Egyptians pictured a person as a network of bodily and spiritual parts. Preservation of the body and ethical living allowed these facets to reunite after death.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ka</strong>: the life-force that required offerings to endure.</li>
  <li><strong>Ba</strong>: a mobile personality, often shown as a human-headed bird visiting the tomb each night.</li>
  <li><strong>Akh</strong>: an enlightened spirit formed when Ka and Ba were harmonized.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mummification, offering cults, and the Opening of the Mouth ceremony animated these elements, leading to the weighing of the heart against the feather of Ma'at.</p>
