  <li>Ascetic rituals and remembrance of one's divine ancestry aimed to liberate the soul from cycles of rebirth.</li>
  <li>Plato's tripartite psyche cast reason as a charioteer directing spirited and appetitive horses toward the realm of Forms.</li>
  <li>Both perspectives urged purification and philosophical discipline to restore the soul's kinship with the divine.</li>
